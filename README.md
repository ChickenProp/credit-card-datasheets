This is a set of credit-card sized datasheets for chips that I use with a Raspberry Pi. I've printed and cut them out for easy reference. They might be useful to other people as well.

The cards don't start in the top-left because my printer can't print all the way to the edges.

It might be useful to move each datasheet to a separate SVG file, and write a tool to allow a user to select some datasheets and create a pdf with just those. It could also allow double-siding, which would be nice.

Note the RPi GPIOs are correct only for revision 1. For revision 2, substitute: 0/8 -> 2/8; 1/9 -> 3/9; 21/2 -> 27/2. (I don't want to clutter the datasheet with both revisions, but having one datasheet per revision might be a good thing given the ability to select a subset of the available datasheets.)
