This is a set of credit-card sized datasheets for chips that I use with a Raspberry Pi. I've printed and cut them out for easy reference. They might be useful to other people as well.

The cards don't start in the top-left because my printer can't print all the way to the edges.

It might be useful to move each datasheet to a separate SVG file, and write a tool to allow a user to select some datasheets and create a pdf with just those. It could also allow double-siding, which would be nice.
